# Fun Facts
Have some fun! Get a random fun fact in the command line simply by typing fun (some configuration to be done). Fun facts are parsed from https://www.thefactsite.com/top-100-random-funny-facts/ and stored in a database. Every time that you type in fun, a random fact from
the database is displayed. I may parse fun facts from more websites to create the database (right now there are only 100 facts).
